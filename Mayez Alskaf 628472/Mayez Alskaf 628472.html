            <h2>Haarlem Noord</h2>

            <p id="HaarlemNoord">
                Haarlem-Noord is a city district of the Dutch municipality of Haarlem with more than 56,000 inhabitants. Until 1927, the area was for the most part part of the former municipality of Schoten. The area just north of Haarlem station had already been annexed in 1884. Here, the Frans Halsbuurt and Kleverparkbuurt were quickly built. Construction of the Ripperdakazerne was started in 1882. After the annexation of Schoten, the former municipality is almost completely built up within 25 years. There are often single-family homes from the 30s, 40s and 50s of the 20th century. The Rijksstraatweg goes in the middle of Haarlem-Noord towards Velsen. Parallel to the Rijksstraatweg is the Cronj√©straat shopping street at the start of the district. To the west, Haarlem-Noord is bounded by the Westelijke Randweg, east by the Vondelweg and Spaarndamseweg. The city district has three important bus stops; Julianapark, Minahassastraat and Delftplein / Spaarne Gasthuis.

The foot represents all leg techniques such as kicking and jumping. Kwon (fist). The hand stands for all hand and arm techniques such as bumps, blocks, gripping, clamping and throwing. Do (the way). The road is the path that you follow while practicing Taekwondo and mainly represents the mental part.</p>
